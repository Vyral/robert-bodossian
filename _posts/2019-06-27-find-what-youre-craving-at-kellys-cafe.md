Welcome to episode one of “Meet Medina County\!”

This time, we went behind the scenes at Kelly’s Cafe with owner Kelly Horter, who sat down for a conversation with us about where her restaurant journey started, what her cafe is all about today, and what kind of food they offer.&nbsp;

“I grew up in a restaurant family,” Kelly said, adding that she had always wanted to own a restaurant. But beyond just feeling comfortable in a restaurant atmosphere, Kelly also noticed an empty niche here in Brunswick. So, nine years ago, she decided to fill it with her very own cafe.&nbsp;

Now, **with the help of her father, Kelly is living her lifelong dream.** &nbsp;Her family and friends aren’t the only ones who support her, however. Kelly also says that the community in Brunswick, as a whole, has been incredibly supportive.&nbsp;

As interesting as the story behind Kelly’s Cafe may be, the thing that really draws people in is, of course, their delicious food.&nbsp;

**Inspired by European cuisine as well as the savory crepes Kelly tried for the first time in Chicago, the menu at Kelly’s Cafe is unlike anything else you’ll find in this area.**

The restaurant is famous for its diverse list off crepes, which range from decadently sweet to mouthwateringly savory. No matter what you’re craving, you’re sure to find something that hits the spot at Kelly’s Cafe.
